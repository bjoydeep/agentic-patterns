    "- Also think of allowing general text entry field allowing engineer to enter what was done, if it was a thumbs down\n",

    "### Capture and store outcomes\n",
    "- Capture the above data and store it in a database\n",

    "- Periodically pull the best-rated incident examples (and their human-approved diagnoses) to create few-shot prompts or even fine-tune a custom model.\n",

    "Some of the other next steps could be -\n",

    "## Build visibility and dashboards\n",
    "- Surface the agents’ findings and verification results in a team dashboard—showing average time to diagnosis, verification pass rates, and automation success rates.\n",
    "- Use that data to spot gaps (e.g. Services that consistently fool the Debugger) and add new special-purpose agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hook into real incident streams\n",
    "- Connect the orchestration function to the monitoring/alerting system (e.g. Prometheus Alertmanager, CloudWatch Alarms, PagerDuty webhooks). Therefore every time an alert fires for “shopping-cart latency,” the agents automatically kick off the dependency→change→error→debug→verify chain.\n",

    "  - looking at change log and\n",
    "  - looking at application logs.\n",
    "Let us say there are agents for metrics, anomaly detection, cluster health (for the cluster on which the service is running on etc).\n",
    "- In that case, the incident could go to a `Planner agent` that decides to breakdown the troubleshooting into steps and call agents for each steps.\n",
